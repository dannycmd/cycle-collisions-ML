    "The STATS19 data is completed by police at the scene of the incident, so I don't think the missing data is inherently meaningful* for most variables i.e. it seems unlikely that police are deliberately not filling in certain fields because they don't want to share the information. It seems more likely that they simply forgot to fill it in, didn't have enough time, couldn't be bothered, the data was corrupted, etc. However, missing data could still be correlated with the casualty severity - I can imagine that police might be more inclined to spend time filling in all the fields on the form if the collision is not very serious and they have time to spare, however if there's a fatality then filling out a long form might be less of a priority. Since my primary goal is to infer the risk factors for cycle collision severity, I don't want to include these missing categories if they have this 'fake' correlation with casualty severity. I will investigate this further by looking at the correlation of each of these variables with the target, using Cramer's V.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Edit: After reading the guidance to police for filling in the STATS19 form, it does actually seem that missing data can have some meaning. For example, if the sex of the driver is missing then this is likely because there was a hit-and-run incident and so the driver could not be identified. I think this backs up my choice to not add \"Missing\" as a separate category, as a hit-and-run incident is not something that could be known before the collision."

Clearly these fields are either mostly filled in or not filled in at all. For example, in the 1st grid vehicle_left_hand_drive is strongly associated with vehicle_manoeuvre and vehicle_location_restricted_lane - and vehicle_left_hand_drive is also associated with casualty_severity. I suspect that the vehicle_left_hand_drive field is only ever filled in if the driver was doing something dangerous, like a U-turn or sitting in a restricted lane, which would explain why vehicle_left_hand_drive is associated with casualty_severity when I wouldn't really expect it to be.\n",
